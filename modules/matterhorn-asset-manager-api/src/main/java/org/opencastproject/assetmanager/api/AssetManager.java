/**
 * The AssetManager stores versioned {@linkplain Snapshot snapshots} of media packages.

 * It also supports the association of {@linkplain Property properties} to a history of snapshots which is called an episode.
 *
 * <h1>Terms</h1>
 * <h2>Snapshot</h2>
 * A snapshot saves a particular version of a media package. Snapshots are immutable and can only be deleted.
 *
 * <h2>Episode</h2>
 * An episode is the set of snapshots of a media package.
 *
 * <h2>Properties</h2>
 * Properties are associated with an episode and have a volatile character.
 * They support the quick and easy storage of meta data.
 * This removes the need for services to create their own persistence layer if they want to associate metadata with a media package.
 *
 * <h1>Notes</h1>
 * Media package IDs are considered to be unique throughout the whole system.
 * The organization ID is just a discriminator and not necessary to uniquely identify a media package.
