  // When you edit the time in the input field directly,
  // instead of using any of the picker's means,
  // the `timepicker` addon syncs that change with it's internal state,
  // to reflect it in its controls.
  // As part of this, it also sets the selection in one of them.
  // This is weird and probably a bug, but this library is also all but dead.
  // Anyway, in Safari this does weird stuff to the focus,
  // making it impossible to enter more than one keystroke most of the time.
  //
  // The workaround is similarly crazy:
  // The input field that has is selection updated
  // is actually never shown in our use of the time picker.
  // By inspecting the code I found the place where it is updated,
  // and I also checked that its state is not used for anything else.
  // (It isn't.)
  // So since this is JavaScript, we can just monkey-patch the appropriate function
  // and get rid of the element before calling through to the original.
  // In a very lucky turn of events, said function actually defensively checks
  // whether or not the element is there, instead of horribly breaking
  // like you would expect from most jQuery-heavy code. üëÄüòÆ‚Äçüí®
  //
  // If you are wondering whether one could remove the element earlier,
  // like immediately after construction instead of every time the time value changes:
  // You can't, because the internal DOM is rebuilt every time that happens.
  //
  // Of course this will break when the `timepicker` is ever updated
  // which‚Äîsee above‚Äîwill obviously never happen. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
