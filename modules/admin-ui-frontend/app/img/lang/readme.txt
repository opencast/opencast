Each flag should:
 - be public domain
 - be an svg image
 - have an aspect ratio of 3:2
 - be named according to the Crowdin languages
 - be without additional decoration (official flags)

A good source for these flags are the national flag articles of Wikipedia.
E.g.: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Germany
