# Manual mapping for language codes.
# Here you can set which language spellings/codes from your system shall be

# You can map a language to the Amberscript code with a colon ':'.
# You can separate multiple mappings with a comma ','.
# Examples:
# language.code.map=english:en
# language.code.map=german:de,french:fr,spanish:es
