#This is the config file for the IngestServiceImpl

# This is an option to update Series metadata during ingest
# The default is true. This will updated an existing series with catalog found in the ingest
# false means the exiting series catalog will not be updated using new series metadata found in the ingest
# In both cases, the series catalog will be created if it does not already exist in Opencast
# In both cases, the catalog for the episode will be created in Opencast

# TODO: consider moving this key to the system.properties if used by other services, such as mediapackage update

# The approximate load placed on the system by ingesting a file
# Since these jobs are *not* dispatched there is no current way to limit the simultaneous number of ingests, but these jobs will block further jobs from running on an already busy admin node
# These jobs involve heavy I/O, so we want them to be expensive, but not cripplingly so
# Default: 0.2

# The Ingest Service is capable of downloading tracks/attachments itself from URLs.
# The Credentials can be set for an external source (example: https://develop.opencast.org)
# The source is written as a regular expression.

# Default: <empty>
