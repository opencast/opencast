## Metadata display configuration
## Override various settings for how metadata catalogs and fields will be
## displayed in the editor. Configuration happens for each catalog separately.
##
## Configuration options for fields:
##
##   show (boolean): Show or hide fields
##   readonly (boolean): Mark fields as readonly
##
## Default behavior:
##
## - The default settings are based on Opencast's admin interface configuration
## - If catalogs are not specified, all of its fields will be displayed
## - If a catalog is specified but empty, it will not be displayed
##
## Example:
##
# # This is the default catalog
# [metadata.configureFields."EVENTS.EVENTS.DETAILS.CATALOG.EPISODE"]
# title = {show = true, readonly = false}
# subject = {show = false}
# description = {readonly = true}
#
# # This catalog is specified but empty, and as such will not be displayed
# [metadata.configureFields."NameOfAnExtendedMetadataCatalog"]

# when working with multiple thumbnails.
# Simple mode only allows users to edit the "primary" thumbnail, as specified
# in the Opencast configuration file
# `etc/org.opencastproject.editor.EditorServiceImpl.cfg`. It is useful
# when there is only a single thumbnail to worry about and you want hide
# potential fallbacks from the user. If a primary thumbnail cannot be
# determined, this falls back to professional mode.
# Type: boolean
# Default: false
