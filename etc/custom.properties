### Opencast configuration properties ###
#########################################

# The internal URL of this Opencast installation, used to locate services running on this instance and for inter-node
# communication in distributed setups.
#
# Note that while the server.url is the public url of this instance, there is the actual public url of an individual
# tenant, which is configured in etc/load/org.opencastproject.organization-<tenant id>.cfg with the default tenant id
# being "mh_default_org".
#
# Also note that if this felix installation is proxied behind an Apache HTTPD reverse proxy, and communication is meant
# to go through that proxy, then server.url should point to the proxy's port (usually 80).
org.opencastproject.server.url=http://localhost:8080

# This property specifies the comma separated list of addresses used to for opencast to listen to.  (e.g. localhost or
# localhost,10.0.0.1). Host names or IP addresses can be used. Default value is "0.0.0.0".
# Comment this out to make Opencast listen to all hosts.
org.ops4j.pax.web.listening.addresses=127.0.0.1

# The url of the remote service registry.  This is used in cases where there is no direct connection to the service
# registry database such as capture agens running in protected environments. This is typically true for capture agents
# and should be set to the url of a server running the actual implementation of the service registry and the path to
# the service registry(admin, worker, etc. See the build profiles in pom.xml for a complete list).
#org.opencastproject.serviceregistry.url=${org.opencastproject.server.url}/services

# The base URL to use for publishing job locations. If left commented out, the local server URL will be used.  Set this
# if you intend to support swapping servers with different IPs or host names.
#org.opencastproject.jobs.url=${org.opencastproject.server.url}

# Whether to accept a job whose load exceeds the host’s max load
# Default: true
#org.opencastproject.job.load.acceptexceeding=true

# The directory where the system will store its processed files (including temporary files).  This directory should
# be persistent between reboots (i.e., not /tmp)
org.opencastproject.storage.dir=${karaf.data}/opencast

# The directory where the configuration files for the Elasticsearch indices are located. This directory should
# be persistent between reboots (i.e., not /tmp)
org.opencastproject.elasticsearch.config.dir=${karaf.etc}/index

# The username and password for a system administrator account. If both `user` and `pass` are set, Opencast will create
# or update that user when started up. If it is commented out, nothing will happen.
# WARNING: Commenting this out later or renaming the user will *not* remove already created user.
org.opencastproject.security.admin.user=admin
org.opencastproject.security.admin.pass=opencast
org.opencastproject.security.admin.roles=ROLE_ADMIN,ROLE_USER,ROLE_OAUTH_USER

# The username and password to present to other Opencast servers when calling their REST endpoints.  The remote server
# must contain matching values.
org.opencastproject.security.digest.user=opencast_system_account
org.opencastproject.security.digest.pass=CHANGE_ME

# The number of times to retry a request if the nonce expires.
org.opencastproject.security.digest.nonce.retries=12

# The configuration property specifying the minimum amount of time in seconds wait before retrying a request after
# a nonce timeout. Default is 300 seconds (5 minutes).
org.opencastproject.security.digest.nonce.base.time=300

# The maximum amount of time to wait in addition to the base time for a random generator to add after a nonce timeout
# so that requests that timeout won't all try again at exactly the same time. Default is 300 seconds (5 minutes).
org.opencastproject.security.digest.nonce.variable.time=300

# This changes the number of seconds from when an internal request is made until a signed URL will expire. More
# specifically, the HTTP client needs access to internal storage areas such as the working file repository as well as to
# distributed artifacts on the downloads and streaming servers, all of which are protected by verification components.
# Default is 60 seconds as it shouldn't take longer than that to make a request to a server. This will have no impact on
# a system where url signing is not configured. For more information please see:
# http://docs.opencast.org/latest/admin/configuration/stream-security/#configuration-of-url-signing-timeout-values
org.opencastproject.security.internal.url.signing.duration=60

# Optional demo accounts with series memberships, but not administrative rights.  If set to 'true', 1000 users will be
# loaded into the sample user directory. Usernames are user0, ..., user999. Passwords are pass0, ..., pass999.
# Default: false
#org.opencastproject.security.demo.loadusers=false

# To enable the LDAP user provider, you must uncomment this line, and run on a JVM that provides the
# "com.sun.jndi.ldap" package.
#org.osgi.framework.system.packages.extra=com.sun.jndi.ldap,com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl

# The base URL of the streaming server (ususally "rtmp://<SERVER_URL>/matterhorn-engage").
# ${org.opencastproject.server.url} can not be used, because the streaming server does not use the HTTP protocol.
# Streaming is not included in the default workflow, since the Red5 streaming server is a 3rd party component that
# requires separate installation.
#org.opencastproject.streaming.url=rtmp://localhost/matterhorn-engage

# The directory where Opencast stores the streams
#org.opencastproject.streaming.directory=${org.opencastproject.storage.dir}/streams

# The port to use for the streaming server, only used by a Wowza streaming server.
#org.opencastproject.streaming.port=1935

# Some newer streaming server versions expect an "flv:" tag within the rtmp URL.
# Not every RTMP-streaming server is compatible with this (i.e. nginx), so this
# is the compatibility mode to the old syntax.
# true  = without "flv:" tag - old syntax
# false = with    "flv:" tag - new syntax
#org.opencastproject.streaming.flvcompatibility=true

# The directory to store media, metadata, and attachments for download from the engage tool
org.opencastproject.download.directory=${org.opencastproject.storage.dir}/downloads

# The base URL for media downloads.
org.opencastproject.download.url=${org.opencastproject.server.url}/static

# Relational Database configuration.  By default, Opencast uses an embedded H2 database.  A standalone database server
# is recommended for production systems.  If you run the ddl script for your db vendor (see docs/scripts/ddl/) manually,
# (this is recommended) set 'ddl-generation' to 'false'.
org.opencastproject.db.ddl.generation=true

# Enable ddl script generation.  This is used by developers to update the ddl scripts, and should not be enabled in
# production.
#org.opencastproject.db.ddl.script.generation=false

# db.vendor can be any of the values listed at under the "eclipselink.target-database" section of
# http://www.eclipse.org/eclipselink/documentation/2.4/jpa/extensions/p_target_database.htm#target-database
# Common values include MySQL, PostgreSQL.
#org.opencastproject.db.vendor=MySQL

# Opencast comes with the jdbc drivers for MySQL (com.mysql.jdbc.Driver) and PostgreSQL (org.postgresql.Driver). To add
# other jdbcDrivers to the Opencast runtime, rebuild the matterhorn-db module with your desired drivers.
#org.opencastproject.db.jdbc.driver=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver

# The jdbc connection url, username, and password
#org.opencastproject.db.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost/opencast
#org.opencastproject.db.jdbc.user=opencast
#org.opencastproject.db.jdbc.pass=dbpassword

# This configures the connection to the Active MQ broker so that we can send and receive messages.
# There are many settings for specifying the broker url: http://activemq.apache.org/activemq-4-connection-uris.html
# Including with failover support details here: http://activemq.apache.org/failover-transport-reference.html
# Default (url): failover://(tcp://127.0.0.1:61616)?initialReconnectDelay=2000&maxReconnectAttempts=2

# configured using `org.opencastproject.*.solr.dir` will be ignored. A dedicated Solr server should be set up in order
