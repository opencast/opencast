# OAuth consumer keys with should be highly trusted.
#
# By default OAuth consumer are regarded as untrusted and a user authenticating via such
# systems receives a rewritten username in the form of "lti:{ltiConsumerGUID}:{ltiUserID}".
# This user is regarded as a new user temporarily existing for the duration of the session.
# Opencast roles associated with the original user will not be attached to this user.
#
# Usernames of users authenticating via highly trusted systems will not be rewritten except
# for the cases configured in the additional options below.
#
# Note that marking a consumer key as highly trusted can be a security risk. If the usernames of sensitive Opencast
# users are not blacklisted, the LMS administrator could create LMS users with the same username and use LTI to grant
# that user access to Opencast. In the default configuration, that includes the `admin` and `opencast_system_account`
# users.
#
# Multiple consumer keys can be configured, by incrementing the counter. The list is read
# sequentially incrementing the counter. If you miss any numbers it will stop looking for
# further consumer keys.

# Allow the Opencast system administrator user to authenticate as such via LTI.

# Note that this user may still authenticate via LTI, but the username will be rewritten,

# Determines which LTI roles should be persisted in the database on LTI user logins.
# The "lti.create_jpa_user_reference" config key has to be "true", otherwise this config key will be ignored.
# The value can be a list of LTI roles identifying users to be persisted or the special value * causing all users to be persisted.
# The value is not case sensitive.

# Examples:
#  - Persist only instructors:
#    lti.create_jpa_user_reference.roles = instructor
#  - Persist only instructors and administrators:
#    lti.create_jpa_user_reference.roles = instructor, administrator
#  - Persist all users:

# Default: *

# Prefix for LTI context based roles based on OAuth consumer keys.
# The LTI context (e.g. the course identifier) is used to generate context roles like “12345_Learner”.
# If multiple LTI consumers are used, this can clash, causing users from one consumer to get access to content from
# another consumer. The prefix can be used to prevent this by generating context roles like “PREFIX1_123_Learner” and
# “PREFIX2_123_Learner” instead.
#
# Context roles may not start with “ROLE_”. Avoid using that as a prefix.
