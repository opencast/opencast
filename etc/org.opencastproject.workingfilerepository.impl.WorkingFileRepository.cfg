# Filename pattern of forbidden characters
#
# Opencast will filter out dangerous pattern from file names in order to make these compatible with different operating
# and file systems and to prevent local security risks like path traversal. For example, the default conversion would
# look like this:
#
#   original:  -problematic-file/../name&&&%.ext
#   converted: _problematic-file____name____.ext
#
# This option allows you to control which characters are not allowed. All parts of the file name matched by the
# configured pattern will be replaced by `_`. The replacement is applied separately to the base file name and the
# extension. In any case, both base name and extension are limited to 255 characters each.
#
# WARNING: This setting is dangerous. It lets you configure Opencast in a way that poses a security risk to your system
#          by e.g. allowing for path traversal attacks. Note that allowing dot characters can lead to paths, which are
#          not allowed to be served (i.e. containing "..").
# BETA:    For a long time, this was a very restricted, fixed value. Consider this to be an unstable configuration which
#          might lead to problems since some component somewhere assumes the old restricted behavior. Test your system
#          very carefully after changing this. Feedback about problems and successful changes are welcome.
#
# Default: (^\\W|[^\\w-])
#filename.forbidden.pattern = (^\\W|[^\\w-_])
