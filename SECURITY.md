Security Policy
===============

Supported Versions
------------------

Only the current and previous major [Opencast release](https://github.com/opencast/opencast/releases) are supported.
This means that if `N.x` is the latest release, `N.x` and `(N-1).x` are supported. Older versions will not receive any
additional updates.


Reporting a Vulnerability
-------------------------

Please report security-related bugs by sending an email to security@opencast.org.
Everything else should be filed as a ticket in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/opencast/opencast/issues)

The [Opencast Security Issue Process](https://docs.opencast.org/develop/developer/#security)
describes how issues are reported, who is responsible for what actions, and how things are handled internally.
