            Hi @${{ github.event.pull_request.user.login }}

            Thank you for contributing to Opencast.

            We noticed that you have not yet filed an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apereo.org/licensing/agreements/icla).
            Doing that (once) helps us to ensure that Opencast stays free for all.
            If you make your contribution on behalf of an institution, you might also want to file a
            [Corporate Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apereo.org/licensing/agreements/ccla)
            (giving you as individual contributor a bit more security as well). It can take a while for
            this bot to find out about new filings, so if you just filed one or both of the above do not
            worry about this message!

            Please let us know if you have any questions regarding the CLA.
