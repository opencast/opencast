.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
matterhorn [ --daemon | --interactive | --quit | --help ]
.SH SUMMARY
.PP
Matterhorn is a free, open-source platform to support the management of
educational audio and video content.

existing video, serve designated distribution channels, and provide user
interfaces to engage students with educational videos.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B --help
Show help message

.SH SYSTEM DAEMON
.PP
Normally you should \f[I]not\f[] start Matterhorn directly unless you
want to have a look at the output for debugging purposes (This would be
the case if the Matterhorn service fails to start at all).
Instead you should run Matterhorn as service.
You can start the service with:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
%>\ service\ matterhorn\ start
\f[]
.fi
.PP
To enable Matterhorn by default in various runlevels (make sure
Matterhorn starts after booting the system) use chkconfig:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
%>\ chkconfig\ --level\ 345\ matterhorn\ on
\f[]
.fi
.PP
You can check the status of Matterhorn anytime by executing:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\ %>\ service\ matterhorn\ status
\f[]
.fi
.SH GETTING STARTED
.PP
After installing Matterhorn and running it as system daemon (service
start matterhorn) open the browser of your choice and navigate to
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
http://localhost:8080/
\f[]
.fi
.PP
This is were you can find the Matterhorn Admin-UI where you can manage
your recordings.
Matterhorn may need a couple of second to load completely.
During this time you might get some error like "Access Denied" or
"Internal server Error".
Do not worry about that, wait a couple of seconds and try again.
The errors should go away (They are not real errors but HTTP status
codes).
.PP
Now you should see a login page.
The default administrative credentials are:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Username:\ admin
Password:\ opencast
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Using this credentials you can log in, start uploading videos, \&...
.SH CONFIGURATION
.PP
While Matterhorn comes preconfigured for testing you probably have to
modify the configuration if you start advanced testing or deploy a
productive system.
The most important things are configured in
/opt/matterhorn/etc/config.properties
.TP
.B org.opencastproject.server.url
This is set to http://localhost:8080 by default, which means that
Matterhorn will only be usable from the local machine as localhost will be
used for all internal links, etc. This is not a protection against access
from the outside.
You should change this if your server should be accessible within a
network.
Set it to your domain name or IP address.
.RS
.RE
