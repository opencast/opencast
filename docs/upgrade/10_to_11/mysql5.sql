-- The deletion date is straight forward, as all existing records can correctly use 'null' as value.
-- Modification date is more tricky. We don't want to make the field nullable, so we have to find a
-- somewhat useful value. But we also don't want to set all values to the unix epoch as code
-- could reasonably assume that almost all modification dates of real world series are unique. So
-- we instead derive the modification dates from the series' events. Unix epoch only for series
-- without events.
--
-- We use 1970-01-02 instead of 1970-01-01 to work around possible timezone problems. The exact value 
-- doesn't matter anyway.
