## Initial Admin UI Design

The initial release of the Admin UI design was completed in the early part of 2015 thanks to the combined
efforts of [Entwine](http://entwinemedia.com/), [ETH Zurich](https://www.ethz.ch/en.html), [SWITCH](https://www.switch.ch/) and [University of Manchester](http://www.manchester.ac.uk/).
The result of this effort is a more technically advanced and intuitive  interface that results in a capture and media management solution that is both powerful and extensible.

The main focus for the new administrative ui was design and usability. While the functionality of the ui has been conceived by the solutions architects at Entwine, a professional team of designers at [Espress Labs](http://espresslabs.com/) defined a consistent design language and provided the development team with design templates for the individual sections of the ui.

The resulting style guide clearly describes how individual parts and pieces are to be designed, which fonts and colors are available, how notifications should be displayed to the user and much more. On top of that, the design team delivered HTML templates for each screen and dialog so that there was little left to do for the frontend engineers but turn the templates into a great looking interactive application.

## HTML

  <p>
  HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. It is the fifth and current version of the HTML standard.
  <br/><br/>
  It was published in October 2014 by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia, while keeping it both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices such as web browsers, parsers, etc. HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4, but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML.
  <br/><br/>
  HTML5 includes detailed processing models to encourage more interoperable implementations; it extends, improves and rationalizes the markup available for documents, and introduces markup and application programming interfaces (APIs) for complex web applications. For the same reasons, HTML5 is also a candidate for cross-platform mobile applications, because it includes features designed with low-powered devices in mind.
