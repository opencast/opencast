Documentation
=============

One important measurement for code quality is its documentation. This is especially the case for open source projects
that count on the support of external developers and a strong community around the code base.  With that in mind, here
are some of the goals you should keep in mind when working within the Opencast codebase.


Package Level Documentation
---------------------------

Package documentation should cover the general concepts that are being used throughout the package, along with the
principal interfaces and classes that are being used.  A good example is provided by the [Java 6 sql package description
](http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/sql/package-summary.html#package_description).


### Where does the documentation go?

The package information should be put into a file called `package-info.java` and reside in the root of the package.
Generally, the package-info is a java class itself consisting of documentation and package declaration only.
Documentation can be found [here](http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/tooldocs/windows/javadoc.html#packagecomment).


### Checklist

In order to achieve decent package documentation, make sure your documentation answers the following questions:

- What problem domain does your package deal with?
- Are there any concepts that the developer should understand?
- What are the different strategies that your package might implement?
- What are the entry points into your package in terms of interfaces and classes?
- What best practices are there to use the package?
- What major requirements need to be met before being able to use the package?
- Is there related external documentation (rfc, specifications) that should be linked?


Classes
-------

By looking at the documentation of a class or an interface, the developer should have a clear idea as to how the class
can be used, what pitfalls there might be in terms of threading, performance etc. Again, a good example can be found in
the [Url class](http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/net/URL.html) of the Java Development Kit.


### Documentation Body

- Has a one-sentence description been given on what the class does or describe?
- Is there a description of concepts that should be known to users of the class?
- Are there possible pitfalls in the area of threading, transactions or performance?
- Are any other issues covered that might arise when using the class?
- Have any constraints be documented, like special behaviour of the `equals()` method?
- Are best practices on how to use the class documented?

### Tags

- Are there related classes or external resources that should be linked using `@see`?


Methods
-------

As with type documentation, the notes on a method should consist of instructions on what to expect in terms of behaviour
when the method is called. Also, the user should be informed about any constraints that might apply to the objects
state, the format of input parameters etc. As an example, take a look at the [constructor for the URL class
](http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/net/URL.html#URL(java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String,%20int,%20java.lang.String))
of the Java Development Kit.


### Documentation Body

- In general, what does the method do?
- Are there any requirements regarding the format of the input parameters?
- What does the method return with respect to input parameter values or state?
- If applicable, are there any constraints regarding an objects state?
- How are special parameter values (e.g. `null`) handled?
- Does the user know what exceptions are thrown under which circumstances?


### Tags

- Are the input parameters documented using the `@param` tag?
- Is the return value documented using the `@return` tag?
- Are there related methods that should be linked using `@see`?
- Are the exceptions documented with `@throws`?


REST Endpoints
--------------

All Opencast REST endpoints must display HTML formatted documentation at the `/docs` path.

Please be sure that your documentation includes:

- An entry for each path pattern, categorized as read and write paths.
- Descriptions for each path pattern, including:
    - The HTTP method (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, â€¦)
    - Required and optional parameters
    - The expected input, including data formats and headers
    - The expected output, including data formats, headers, and HTTP response codes
