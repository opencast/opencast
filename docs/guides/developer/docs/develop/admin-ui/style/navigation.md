## Navigation Tab

The section navigation tab is placed on the left side of the viewing area
for a user to easily access other sections of the Admin UI.

<div class="row-flex">
  <img src="../../../../img/navigation-1.png" alt="Navigation Menu Hidden" />
  <p>
    By default the main menu is hidden to allow for the maximum viewing area and to have a clean navigation area
    displaying the current important location.
    <br/><br/>
    Clicking on the main menu button displays the menu bar with all of the appropriate menu icons (Shown below).
  </p>
</div>

<div class="row-flex">
  <img src="../../../../img/navigation-2.png" alt="Navigation Menu Visible" />
  <p>
    The expanded main menu consists of a number of icons, each representing an available section in the Admin UI.
    <br/><br/>
    The main menu button consists of an anchor (<code>a</code>) tag that wraps around a text (<code>i</code>)
    element which has a <code>background-image</code> to display the icon.
    <br/><br/>
    The text (<code>i</code>) element also contains <code>data-title</code>
    attribute that displays the tooltip (on hover over the icon) and is updated by the page translator object.
