Reviewing, Merging and Declining Pull Requests
==============================================

Before a patch is merged into an official branch, it needs to be reviewed by a committer. During a
review, the reviewer tries to make sure that the patch merges without conflicts, that it works as expected and that
it does not break anything else.

If the reviewer discovers any kind of issue, he should leave a comment in the pull request view of GitHub and let the
contributor fix the problem. Reviewer and contributor should work together to fix any problem with the pull requests
before it is ready to go into the codebase.

Reviewing Rules
---------------

* Reviews and merges need to be done by committers
* Reviewers should come from a different institution than the contributor
* Feature pull requests are only allowed to be merged into the branch develop
* Pull requests that change translation keys are only allowed to be merged into the branch develop
* After taking up a review (or being assigned to one), a basic review has to be done within the following 14 days for a
  bug fix or 21 days for a feature. A basic review means that either some issues should be pointed out or the pull
  request should be approved
* No pull request shall be without a reviewer for more than 14 days. If no committer is willing to take up the review
  on their own, the review will be assigned
* Any committer may merge an arbitrary set of *approved* pull requests, even if he is not the official reviewer, given
  that:
    * The committer sends an announcement to the development list 24 hours in advance, including a list of the pull
      requests to be merged and no other committer objects to that
    * The committer checks that all the patches are working (which basically means to review the patch set as a whole)
* A reviewer may decline a pull request if issues were pointed out but were neither fixed nor discussed for more than
  14 days. It is generally suggested to try to contact the contributor before declining the pull request and to
  additionally bring the problem up at the technical meeting


Reviewing a Pull Request
------------------------

There is no list of things you are required to do as reviewer of a pull request. Our primary goals in doing reviews for
all pull requests are to ensure that:

* There are no bugs in the pull request
    * The feature works as advertised
    * It does not break any other features
* There are no obvious legal problems
    * [Licenses seem to be fine](license.md)
    * Licenses are added to the `NOTICES` file
* Feature documentation is in place
* An upgrade path exists (usually relevant for database changes)


The exact review process heavily depends on the type, size and purpose of the pull request.

Here are some things a reviewer should usually do:

* Check if code looks sensible (e.g. no nonsensical files, no obvious formatting errors, no large binary files, â€¦)
* Locally run Opencast and verify that the issue has been fixed (as described in the pull request and/or the GitHub
  issue) or the feature does what it is supposed
* Check the documentation

Some changes require special attention:

Folder                         | Description
:------------------------------|------------
etc/listproviders              | Changes here might need to be reflected in the static mockup data for the Admin UI facade found in modules/admin-ui/src/test/resources/app/admin-ng/resources
modules/admin-ui/src/main/java | In case the interface of the Admin UI facade changes, those changes need to be also reflected in the static mockup data for the Admin UI facade found in modules/admin-ui/src/test/resources/app.
