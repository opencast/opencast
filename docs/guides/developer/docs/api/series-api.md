### GET /api/series

Returns a list of series.

The following query string parameters are supported to filter, sort and pagingate the returned list:

Query String Parameter | Required | Type      | Description
:----------------------|:---------|:----------|:-----------
`filter`               | no       | [`string`](types.md#basic) | A comma seperated list of filters to limit the results with. A filter is the filter's name followed by a colon ":" and then the value to filter with so it is the form `Filter Name`:`Value to Filter With`. See the below table for the list of available filters.
`sort`                 | no       | [`string`](types.md#basic) | Sort the results based upon a list of comma seperated sorting criteria. In the comma seperated list each type of sorting is specified as a pair such as: `Sort Name`:`ASC` or `Sort Name`:`DESC`. Adding the suffix ASC or DESC sets the order as ascending or descending order and is mandatory. See the below table about the available sort names in the table below.
`limit`                | no       | [`string`](types.md#basic) | The maximum number of results to return for a single request.
`offset`               | no       | [`string`](types.md#basic) | Number of results to skip based on the limit. 0 is the first set of results up to the limit, 1 is the second set of results after the first limit, 2 is third set of results after skipping the first two sets of results etc.

The following filters are available:

Filter Name    | Description
:--------------|:-----------
`contributors` | Series where the contributors specified in the metadata field match.
`creator`      | Series where the creator specified in the metadata field match.
`creationDate` | Series that were created between two dates. The two dates are in UTC format to the second i.e. yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ e.g. 2014-09-27T16:25Z. They are seperated by a forward slash (url encoded or not) so an example of the full filter would be CreationDate:2015-05-08T00:00:00.000Z/2015-05-10T00:00:00.000Z
`language`     | Series based upon the language specified.
`license`      | Series based upon the license specified.
`organizers`   | Series where the organizers specified in the metadata field match.
`managedAcl`   | Series who have the same managed acl name.
`subject`      | By the subject they are a part of.
`textFilter`   | Filters series where any part of the series' metadata fields match this value.
`title`        | By the title of the series.

The list can be sorted using the following fields:

Sort Name      | Description
:--------------|:-----------
`contributors` | By the series contributors.
`created`      | By when the series was created.
`creator`      | By who created the series.
`title`        | By the title of the series.

## Metadata

This section describes how to use the Application API to work with metadata catalogs associated to series.

Opencast manages the bibliographic metadata of series using metadata catalogs which are identified by flavors.
The default metadata catalog for Opencast series has the flavor `dublincore/series`. Opencast additionally supports
extended metadata catalogs for series that can be configured.

The Application API supports both the default series metadata catalog and series extended metadata catalogs.
For the default series metadata catalog, the metadata is directly returned in the responses.

Since the metadata catalogs can be configured, the Application API provides a facility to retrieve the catalog
configuration of series metadata catalogs. For more details about this mechanism, please refer to
["Metadata Catalogs"](types.md#metadata-catalogs).

### GET /api/series/{series_id}/metadata

Returns a series' metadata of all types.

__Response__

`200 (OK)`: The series' metadata are returned as [`catalogs`](types.md#catalogs)
`404 (NOT FOUND)`: The specified series does not exist.
