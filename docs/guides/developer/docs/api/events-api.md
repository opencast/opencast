:----------------------|:----------------------------|:-----------
`filter`               | [`string`](types.md#basic)  | A comma-separated list of filters to limit the results with (see [Filtering](usage.md#filtering)). See the below table for the list of available filters. Version 1.5.0 and newer support comma separated use of the `filter` keyword, creating a logical OR.
`sort`                 | [`string`](types.md#basic)  | A comma-separated list of sort criteria (see [Sorting](usage.md#sorting)).  See the below table for the list of available sort criteria

`offset`               | [`integer`](types.md#basic) | The index of the first result to return (see [Pagination](usage.md#pagination))

The following filters are available:

### POST /api/events

Creates an event by sending metadata, access control list, processing instructions and files in a [multipart request](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc1341/7_2_Multipart.html).

Multipart Form Parameters  | Type                            | Description
:--------------------------|:--------------------------------|:-----------
`acl`                      | [`acl`](types.md#acl)           | A collection of roles with their possible action
`metadata`                 | [`catalogs`](types.md#catalogs) | Event metadata as Form param
`presenter`                | [`file`](types.md#file)         | Presenter movie track
`presentation`             | [`file`](types.md#file)         | Presentation movie track
`audio`                    | [`file`](types.md#file)         | Audio track
`processing`               | [`string`](types.md#basic)      | Processing instructions task configuration
`scheduling`               | [`string`](types.md#basic)      | Scheduling information (version 1.1.0 and higher)

__Scheduling__

Field      | Required | Type                                 | Description
:----------|:---------|:-------------------------------------|:-----------
`agent_id` | Yes      | [`string`](types.md#basic)           | The technical identifier of the capture agent
`start`    | Yes      | [`datetime`](types.md#date-and-time) | The date and time (UTC) when the recording shall start
`end`      | Yes\*    | [`datetime`](types.md#date-and-time) | The date and time (UTC) when the recording shall end
`duration` | Yes\*    | [`integer`](types.md#basic)          | The duration of the recording in milliseconds
`rrule`    | Yes\*    | [`rrule`](types.md#recurrence-rule)  | The recurrence rule used to create multiple scheduled events

\* When creating a single scheduled event, either `end` or `duration` must be specified. When creating multiple
scheduled events, the fields `end`, `duration` and `rrule` are required

To create a single scheduled event, omit the field `rrule`. You can specify the start and end of the recording by
using either the fields `start` and `end` or the fields `start` and `duration`.
Please note that specifying both `end` and `duration` is not valid.

To create multiple scheduled events, the field `rrule` is used. This field contains the recurrence rule used to
determine the dates and times the scheduled events shall be created within the time period specified by the fields
`start` and `end` + `duration`.
Please note that `duration` is a mandatory field when creating multiple scheduled events.

__Additional Notes__

- Both `start` and `end` must be specified in UTC

### DELETE /api/events/{event_id}

Retracts possible publications and deletes an event. Since version 1.6.0 published events will be retracted by this 
endpoint, if you use a version previous to 1.6.0 don't call this endpoint before retracting published events.  

__Response__

`202 (ACCEPTED)`: The retraction of publications has started.<br/>
`204 (NO CONTENT)`: The event has been deleted.<br/>
`404 (NOT FOUND)`: The specified event does not exist.


# Access Policy

Most events in Opencast come with an access control list (ACL), containing entries that map actions to roles, either
allowing or denying that action.

The section on roles in the chapter on [Authorization](authorization.md#AccessControl) will help shed some light on what
kind of roles are available and how they are assigned to the current user.

For more information about access control lists, please refer to [Access Control Lists](types.md#access-control-lists).

### GET /api/events/{event_id}/acl

Returns an event's access policy.

__Response__

`200 (OK)`: The access control list for the specified event is returned as [`acl`](types.md#acl).<br/>
`404 (NOT FOUND)`: The specified event does not exist.

# Metadata

This section describes how to use the External API to work with metadata catalogs associated to events.

Opencast manages the bibliographic metadata of series using metadata catalogs which are identified by flavors.
The default metadata catalog for Opencast events has the flavor `dublincore/episode`. Opencast additionally supports
extended metadata catalogs for series that can be configured.

The External API supports both the default event metadata catalog and events extended metadata catalogs.
For the default event metadata catalog, the metadata is directly returned in the responses.

Since the metadata catalogs can be configured, the External API provides a facility to retrieve the catalog
configuration of series metadata catalogs. For more details about this mechanism, please refer to
["Metadata Catalogs"](types.md#metadata-catalogs).

### GET /api/events/{event_id}/metadata

Returns the complete set of metadata.

__Response__

`200 (OK)`: The metadata collection is returned as [`catalogs`](types.md#catalogs).<br/>
`404 (OK)`: The specified event does not exist.

# Scheduling Information

### GET /api/events/{event_id}/scheduling

Available since API version 1.1.0.

Returns an event's scheduling information.

__Response__

`200 (OK)`: The scheduling information is returned.<br/>
`204 (NO CONTENT)`: The event is not scheduled.<br/>
`404 (NOT FOUND)`: The specified event does not exist.

```
{
  "agent_id": "ca24",
  "start": "2018-03-27T16:00:00Z",
  "end": "2018-03-27T19:00:00Z",
  "inputs": ["default"]
}
```

### PUT /api/events/{event_id}/scheduling

Available since API version 1.1.0.

Update the scheduling information of the event with id `{event_id}`.

Form Parameters             |Type            | Description                              | Default | Version
:---------------------------|:---------------|:-----------------------------------------|:--------|:-------
`scheduling`                | `string`       | The scheduling information.              | <span class="required">Required</span>| 1.1.0
`allowConflict`             | `boolean`      | Allow conflicts when updating scheduling.| false   | 1.2.0

__Sample__

scheduling:
```
{
  "agent_id": "ca24",
  "start": "2018-03-27T16:00:00Z",
  "end": "2018-03-27T19:00:00Z",
  "inputs": ["default"]
}
```

__Response__

`204 (NO CONTENT)`: The scheduling information of the event has been updated.<br/>
`400 (BAD REQUEST)`: The request is invalid or inconsistent.<br/>
`404 (NOT FOUND)`: The specified event does not exist.<br/>
`409 (CONFLICT)`: The scheduling information could not be updated due to a conflict. A list of conflicting events is returned.

In case of a conflict:
```
[
  {
    "start":"2018-03-21T14:00:00Z",
    "end":"2018-03-21T16:00:00Z",
    "title":"My Event 06"
  }
]
```

`allowConflict` allows the schedule to be updated without checking for conflicts.
To allow conflicts (`true`) the call **MUST** be made with a user that has an _Administrative Role_.

If not handled properly this will likely cause two or more events to be
scheduled on a particular capture agent at the same time, which will then
cause a capture failure for all but one of the events.

The person making this call and allowing conflicts to exist, will bear the
responsibility of resolving the conflicts that might result.
