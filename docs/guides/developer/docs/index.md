Opencast Development Guides
===========================

Welcome to the Opencast development documentation! If you are new to Opencast, be sure to check out our
[Administration Guide](https://docs.opencast.org/stable/admin/).

This documentation will help you if you want to participate in Opencast development. It is split into three main
sections:

- [Participate](./participate/development-process.md) contains information on all the different ways you can take a
  part in the Opencast project. Besides programming, there are many other tasks required to keep the project running.
  Consider helping with translations or even becoming a release manager!
- [Develop](./develop/setup-opencast-for-develop.md) provides helpful tips and tricks on how set up your development
  environment, as well as write and debug your code.
- [Opencast Architecture](./architecture/overview.md) supplies in depth, technical description on the different parts
  that make up Opencast, such as the External API. If you are looking for information on how to configure certain parts,
  check the [Administration Guide](https://docs.opencast.org/stable/admin/#configuration/) instead.
