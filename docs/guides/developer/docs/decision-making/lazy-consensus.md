Lazy Consensus
==============

The concept of "Lazy Consensus" is very important in our project. Lazy Consensus means that when you are convinced that
you know what the community would like to see happen you can simply assume that you already have consensus and get on
with the work. You do not have to insist people discuss and/or approve your plan, and you certainly do not need to call
a vote to get approval. You just assume you have the communities support unless someone says otherwise.

We have a time machine (git), this means that as long as you commit (or submit patches) early and often the community
has plenty of opportunity to indicate disapproval. If you believe the community will support your action you can operate
on lazy consensus as long as you are prepared to roll back any work should a valid objection is raised.

Avoiding Unnecessary Discussion
-------------------------------

The key thing about lazy consensus is that it is easier for people to agree, by doing nothing, than it is to object,
which requires an alternative to be proposed. This has two effects, firstly people are less likely to object for the
sake of it and secondly it cuts down on the amount of unnecessary mail traffic and discussion.

Lazy consensus means we can avoid waiting for a community based decision before proceeding. However, it does require
everyone who cares for the health of the project to watch what is happening, as it is happening. Objecting too far down
the road will cause upset, but objecting (or asking for clarification of intent) early is likely to be greeted with
relief that someone is watching and cares.

Stating Lazy Consensus
----------------------

Sometimes a member of the community will believe a specific action is the correct one for the project but are not sure
that there will be consensus. In these circumstances they may not wish to proceed with the work without giving the
community an opportunity to feedback. In these circumstances they can make the proposal and state Lazy Consensus is in
operation.

Proposals should be send to list, preferably the development list. It is common to indicate proposals by including the
string `[#proposal]` at the beginning of the subject to make it easier for the community to identify that the mail
contains an important proposal.

What this means is that they make a proposal and state that they will start implementing it in 72 hours unless someone
objects. 72 hours is chosen because it accounts for different timezones and non-opencast commitments.

In this approach the original proposal is not insisting that there is a discussion around their proposal, nor are they
requesting that the community explicitly supports their actions. However, this differs from assuming lazy consensus
since it allows space and time to [express support or objections](consensus-building.md) and corrections to the proposal
before work begins.

Silence is Consent
------------------

People may choose to indicate their support for the actions taken with a +1 mail - quick and easy to read and reassuring
for the implementer. However, remember, in a lazy consensus world silence is the equivalent to support. This can take
some time to get used to.
