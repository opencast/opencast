## Recordings
A general term used to describe activities that occur within an Opencast system including Series and Events.

## Events
Events refer to a single episode or lecture that is recorded or uploaded. Typically they belong to a Series (see also Series section), however there can also be ad-hoc recordings that do not belong to a Series. You can access the Events page from the **Main Menu > Recordings > Events**.

## Ad-hoc events
Ad-hoc events that occur spontaneously and may or may not belong to a Series. An example of an adhoc recording may be a recording of a dissertation practice or a recording of an unplanned meeting.
Note: Not all capture agents support ad-hoc recordings. Refer to the capture agent’s manual to find out if it has this capability.

## Series
A Series is the equivalent of entire course and typically contains multiple Events (see also Events section) that occur across a defined period of time. You can access the Events page from the **Main Menu > Recordings > Series**.

An example of a Series which consists of four (4) events:

* Series Name: Better Development Through the Use of Scrum Techniques
    * Event 1: Introduction to Scrum
    * Event 2: Sprint Planning
    * Event 3: Daily Scrum
    * Event 4: Sprint Review Meeting

Events that belong to a Series inherit properties such as Access Policy and Themes.
