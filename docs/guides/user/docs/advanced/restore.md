# Restoring to local storage

To manually restore a mediapackage to local storage you select the events you wish to restore, and start a task

![img_select_events][]

## Step 1: Confirm the events

![img_confirm_events][]

This page confirms which event(s) you wish to restore

## Step 2: Select the task

![img_restore_task][]

Select the Restore task from the dropdown

## Step 3: Select the restore type

![img_restore_1][]

Select local storage in the list of restore targets.  At the present time there are no other restoration targets, so no
action is needed here.

## Step 4: Confirm

![img_restore_2][]

Confirm that the correct values have been set

At this point a workflow will launch which will restore the event to local storage.  Depending on where the Event is
currently located this may take many hours.
