Enable HTTPS directly in Opencast
=================================

Edit `etc/org.ops4j.pax.web.cfg` and set:

```
# This property specifies the comma separated list of addresses used by Opencast to listen to (e.g. localhost or
# localhost,10.0.0.1). Host names or IP addresses can be used. Pax Web default value is "0.0.0.0".
org.ops4j.pax.web.listening.addresses=0.0.0.0

# Whether Opencast itself should handle HTTPS traffic.
# Even if you set this to 'false',you can still use an HTTP proxy to handle SSL.
org.osgi.service.http.secure.enabled=true

# The secure server port to use if running Opencast with HTTPS (as opposed to
# a proxy handling HTTPS).
# Note that we use the docker proxy for the port-mapping from 8843 from within
# the container to 443 at the host
# Don't run Opencast with root privileges, which is a security issue
org.osgi.service.http.port.secure=8443

# Path to the keystore file.
# Use the Java `keytool` to generate this file.
# Example:
#   keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -validity 365 -alias serverkey \
#     -keypass password -storepass password -keystore keystore.jks
org.ops4j.pax.web.ssl.keystore=<path_to_keystore>

# Password used for keystore integrity check.
org.ops4j.pax.web.ssl.password=<the_keystore_password>

# Password used for keystore.
org.ops4j.pax.web.ssl.keypassword=<the_key_password>
```


Port-Forwarding required
------------------------

Note that Opencast most likely can't bind to port 443. That's why you still
need to reverse-proxy or port-forward if you want to avoid URLs with port
specified like `https://host:8443/` which is technically perfectly okay but may
confuse users or may be perceived as "ugly".

Here is a non-comprehensive lists of tools and methods which can be used for
port forwarding:


### Port-Forwarding with iptables

A rule like

```sh
iptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 443 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8443
# Allow also localhost traffic to use :443
# iptables -A OUTPUT -t nat -o lo -p tcp --dport 443 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8443
```

should do the job after replacing `eth0` with the network interface your
Opencast consumers will connect on. Note that you usually want to persist the
rule.


### Port-Forwarding with docker(-proxy)

When starting a container from an Opencast image, either insert a
command line argument to docker run: `-p 443:8443` or add a `ports:`
in `docker-compose.yaml`.


### Port-Forwarding with sniproxy

[Sniproxy](https://github.com/dlundquist/sniproxy) can be used as well,
especially if you have multiple servers running on the same machine that handle
HTTPS individually (no termination proxy).

```
user, pidfile, error_log ...

listen 443 {
    proto tls
    table https_hosts
    fallback 127.0.0.1:8443

    access_log {
        filename /var/log/sniproxy/https_access.log
        priority notice
    }
}

table https_hosts {
    .*\.opencast\.example\.org 127.0.0.1:8443
}
```


Creating the keystore
---------------------

What you need is the TLS private key and the certificate including the
whole chain between the root certificate, all intermediates and the
certificate itself.


### Step 1: Obtaining the certificate chain

If you only have the key and the certificate, I recommend
[certificatechain.io](https://certificatechain.io/) or
[cert-chain-resolver](https://github.com/zakjan/cert-chain-resolver).
The latter can be used as follows:

```bash
# Obtain the chain for cert.pem and save it at opencast.chain.pem.tmp
# The -s command switch includes the root certificate; this is not
# mandatory and might add some overhead
cert-chain-resolver -s -o "opencast.chain.pem.tmp" "cert.pem"

# Verify the certificate using the chain
openssl verify -crl_download -crl_check -untrusted "opencast.chain.pem.tmp" "cert.pem"
```

### Step 2: Create the p12 keystore

If the private key (assumed to be `key.pem`) is encrypted
(password protected), issue the following command. Note that there
are safer ways supplying the key's password to OpenSSL.

```bash
openssl pkcs12 \
        -export \
        -inkey "key.pem" \
        -passin "pass:<the_keys_password>" \
        -in "opencast.chain.pem.tmp" \
        -name "serverkey" \
        -out "opencast.p12" \
        -passout "pass:<the_keystore_password>"
```

In case the private key is not protected by password:

```bash
openssl pkcs12 \
        -export \
        -inkey "key.pem" \
        -in "opencast.chain.pem.tmp" \
        -name "serverkey" \
        -out "opencast.p12" \
        -passout "pass:<the_keystore_password>"
```


### Step 3: Import the p12 keystore into a Java keystore:

```bash
keytool \
        -importkeystore \
        -srckeystore "opencast.p12" \
        -srcstoretype "pkcs12" \
        -srcstorepass "<the_keystore_password>" \
        -destkeystore "keystore.jks" \
        -storepass "<the_keystore_password>"
# print out details about the JKS built
keytool \
        -keystore "keystore.jks" \
        -list \
        -destalias serverkey \
        -storepass "<the_keystore_password>"
```

[There exists a shell script automating that task
](https://gist.github.com/pawohl/dd92ff4909e3e2704e36dec747ea238e).


Default to HTTPS
----------------

When finished, restarted and verified that HTTPS works as expected,
you can change Opencast's default URL to the HTTPS one.

Set `org.opencastproject.server.url` to the  HTTPS-URL in
`etc/custom.properties`.

```ini
org.opencastproject.server.url=https://opencast.example.com
```
