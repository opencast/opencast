Notes:

* reason and description must be provided for the *create* action.
* *create* will not create duplicate comments: if there is already a comment with the same reason and description,
  a new comment will not be created.
* *resolve* and *delete* will perform no action if no comment matches the provided parameters (reason, description,
   or reason and description). If more than one comment matches the parameters, only the first matching comment will be
   resolved or deleted.
