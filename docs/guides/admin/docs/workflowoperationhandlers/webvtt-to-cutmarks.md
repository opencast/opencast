WebVTT to CutMarks Operation
===========================

ID: `webvtt-to-cutmarks`

Description
-----------

This operation parses a WebVTT Subtitle File and generates a JSON of CutMarks based on the Subtitle Timestamps.
It's primary intention is to be used as a silence detection based on available subtitle information.

With the CutMarks to SMIL workflow operation this JSON can be converted to a SMIL that
can be used in the [Video Editor](editor-woh.md) for cutting.


Parameter Table
