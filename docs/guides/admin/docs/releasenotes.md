# Opencast 14: Release Notes

## Opencast 14.3

The off-schedule release of Opencast 14. This release includes fixes from Opencast 13.10 release,
see [release notes of Opencast 13.10](https://docs.opencast.org/r/13.x/admin/#releasenotes/#opencast-1310)

Additionally, the following changes are part of this release.

- Fix admin interface permissions ([#5167](https://github.com/opencast/opencast/pull/5167))
- Fix Admin Interface Redirect ([#5166](https://github.com/opencast/opencast/pull/5166))

## Opencast 14.2

Opencast 14.2 is a minor release. The release fixes corrupt zip headers in the distributed jar files and elasticsearch
package imports. This was causing Opencast to fail at startup in combination with a recent OpenJDK security update.

The alternative to updating to this release is to run Java with `-Djdk.util.zip.disableZip64ExtraFieldValidation=true`.
Setting this will disable the new security check.

Additionally, the following changes are part of this release.

- Fix changed pax web config keys ([#5124](https://github.com/opencast/opencast/pull/5124))

See [changelog](changelog.md#opencast-141) for a comprehensive list of changes.

## Opencast 14.0

### New Admin UI

Opencast 14 brings with it a new version of the Admin UI. The new Admin UI continues with the same look and
feel, but uses new technologies under the hood. It strives to be robust and easy to develop for, while having all the
same functionality users expect from the old UI.

For now, the new Admin UI has not quite reached those goals yet. Therefore, it is not enabled by default and marked
as beta. If you wish to try it out, you can easily do so by going to `https://your-opencast/admin-ui/index.html`
(don't worry if it looks like nothing has changed, the look is *really* similar :)). If you find any issues,
please report them at [GitHub project issue board](https://github.com/opencast/opencast-admin-interface/issues).

For notes on how to set the new Admin UI as your default, check [Admin UI](modules/admin-ui.md).
