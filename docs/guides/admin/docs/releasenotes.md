# Opencast 16: Release Notes

## Opencast 16.1

This is an important bugfix release fixing a problem preventing the presentation node from properly starting up and
therefor breaking cluster installations. Additional, it fixes a problem with Tobira harvesting new events. Don't try to
use 16.0 use this release!

It also comes with a lot more bug fixes. Especially the new admin interface got a lot of work.

## Opencast 16.0

### Features, Improvements and Behavior changes

- Replaced Solr Search with OpenSearch/Elasticsearch. [[#5597](https://github.com/opencast/opencast/pull/5597)]
- Removed Paella 6 with OC 16. [[#5605](https://github.com/opencast/opencast/pull/5605)]
- Added Playlists. Playlists are a list of videos, similar to the same concept in YouTube. This provides an n:m mapping,
  meaning that every playlist can contain multiple videos, and each video can be included in multiple playlists. (As
  opposed to the 1:n mapping of Opencast series, where each video is part of at most one series.)
  [[#5478](https://github.com/opencast/opencast/pull/5478)]
- Added Playlists to Tobira Harvest API. [[#5734](https://github.com/opencast/opencast/pull/5734)]
- Whisper is the new default STT engine [[#5473](https://github.com/opencast/opencast/pull/5473)]
- Implemented the ability to define multiple custom roles and custom roles that need to be added
  [[#5312](https://github.com/opencast/opencast/pull/5312)]
- The default encoding profiles changed to be less restrictive about GOP size, giving the codec more opportunity to
  compress better.[[#5545](https://github.com/opencast/opencast/pull/5545)]
- Added the possibility to enable 360°videos with paella player 7.
  [[#5592](https://github.com/opencast/opencast/pull/5592)]
- Turned old admin interface into a plugin. This patch disables the old admin interface by default. Users can still
  activate this if they really want/need the old interface. [[#5811](https://github.com/opencast/opencast/pull/5811)]
