# Opencast 15: Release Notes

## Opencast 15.2

Opencast valentines edition! A small release this time, but Opencast 15.2 includes a small change to the standard
workflows. Please check if it affects you.

### Configuration changes

- **Don't create composites for new editor**
  Creating composites for the editor was removed from the `schedule-and-upload` workflow since the new editor can

## Opencast 15.0

### Features

#### Subtitles as first class citizens
With Opencast 15 we want to put more emphasis on subtitles. You can find more details on how subtitles should be
handled going forward in [Subtitles](./configuration/subtitles.md).

This comes with a bit of migration. Namely, subtitles should not be stored as "attachments" or "catalogs" anymore, but
as "media" (as they are called in the Admin UI) or "tracks" (as they are called internally). Therefore, all subtitle
files currently stored as attachments or catalogs in your events should be moved to tracks. This can easily be
accomplished with the "changetype" workflow operation handler new to Opencast 15. See example below. (Subtitles should
then be republished)

Additionally, we recommend adding a language tag `lang:<language-code>` to your subtitle files. While tags for subtitles
are optional, the flavor will not encode the given language for a subtitle anymore, so a language tag is useful for
identification and display purposes.
You can read more about subtitles tags in [Subtitles](./configuration/subtitles.md).

If your subtitles are not in WebVTT format, they should be converted to WebVTT as well. While other formats are possible,
WebVTT is the only one that will be guaranteed to work.

### Improvements
- The analyze-mediapackage workflow operation can now generate variables regarding the existence of publications
  (example: `publication_engage_player_exists`) [[#5419](https://github.com/opencast/opencast/pull/5419)]
- Opencast Studio now allows users to select a series (from all series they have write access to) when uploading.
  If `upload.seriesId` is set, then that series is pre-selected in the series-selector, but the user can still change it.
  If you require the old behavior, set `upload.seriesField` to `hidden`.
  [[#5418](https://github.com/opencast/opencast/pull/5418)]
- Opencast Studio and Opencast Editor received a graphical redesign. This just changes their appearance, not their
  functionality.
- Java 17 is now supported.
  [[#4966](https://github.com/opencast/opencast/pull/4966)]
- The asset manager now supports multiple archive storages. Please be aware that spreading your archive across multiple
  file system will likely result in performance decrease, so it is still recommended to avoid it if you can.
  [[#4955](https://github.com/opencast/opencast/pull/4955)]
- The oc-remember-me cookie can now be shared between nodes, so users don't have to log into every node individually.
  [[#4951](https://github.com/opencast/opencast/pull/4951)]

### Behavior changes
- The default admin ui is now the "new" admin ui. If it does not suit your needs for whatever reason, you can always
  switch back the "old" admin ui in `etc/ui-config/mh_default_org/runtime-info-ui/settings.json`
  [[#5414](https://github.com/opencast/opencast/pull/5414)]
- The editor workflow operation now copies over tags from source tracks to trimmed tracks.
  This was already the case when trimming was skipped. If you relied on the old behavior,
  you might need to amend your workflows.
  [[#5409](https://github.com/opencast/opencast/pull/5409)]
- With this release, there will no longer be a snapshot taken to archive new assets uploaded to an existing event _before_
  the workflow is started. Instead, the workflow is expected to take care of this. The community workflow already did
  this, but if you have custom workflows, you might need to make changes to ensure this.
  [[#5247](https://github.com/opencast/opencast/pull/5247)]
- Restrictions in regard to what kind of streams can be selected in the old integrated video editor were eased to allow
  for more diverse use cases. Previous errors were demoted to warnings. The user still has to select at least one stream,
  but publishing of e.g. an audio stream without a video stream is now allowed. For more details see PR 5023.
  [[#5023](https://github.com/opencast/opencast/pull/5023)]
- The default workflow for publishing videos will no longer render the video metadata on the preview Image.
  Instead, a simple cover image without any text will be created and displayed.
  You can revert this by simply adding the "coverimage" WOH back to the "partial-publish" workflow (look out for the
  target-flavor and tags).
  [[#5353](https://github.com/opencast/opencast/pull/5353)]
- The speech-to-text workflow operation will automatically set the tags `generator` and `generator-type` and no longer
  have to be configured in the workflow.
  [[#5352](https://github.com/opencast/opencast/pull/5352)]
- Paella Player 6 has been turned into a plugin. If you are still using it, you will need to enable it.
  [[#4965](https://github.com/opencast/opencast/pull/4965)]
- The publish-engage workflow operation has a new configuration option called `add-force-flavors`. It allows adding
  elements to an existing publication via the `merge` strategy without overwriting elements with the same flavor.
  [[#4617](https://github.com/opencast/opencast/pull/4617)]
