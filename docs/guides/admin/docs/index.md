Opencast Administration Guide
=============================

Welcome to the Matterhorn Universe! Matterhorn is an open-source enterprise
level lecture recording system. The core of the system delivers functionality
for scheduling, media encoding, editing and content delivery. For lecture
capture, Matterhorn provides capture agent software and third party appliances
are available. An awesome community provides new features and support.


The Software

Matterhorn contains everything you need for scheduling captures, trimming,
captioning, and conversion of output media to several formats and our engage
components.  The core can be deployed on one (all-in-one deployment) or many

with the needs of your university.
