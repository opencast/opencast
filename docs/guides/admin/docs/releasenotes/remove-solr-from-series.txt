The Series Service does not require a Solr Index anymore, simplifying the installation of Opencast.

API changes
-----------
- [[#3204](https://github.com/opencast/opencast/pull/3204)] - Remove fulltext search query from series endpoint.
Add the query to the External API.

Optional: Delete Series Service Solr Index
-----------------------
Starting with Opencast 12, the Series Service does not store data in its Solr Index anymore. Therefore, the index can
be deleted to save on disk space (Although in most cases that won't be more than a few megabyte). Unless you setup Solr
yourself, the index can likely be found under `/var/lib/opencast/solr-indexes/series/`.
