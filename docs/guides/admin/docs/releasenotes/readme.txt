Release Notes for Next Major Release
====================================

If you modify features or configuration which should be mentioned in the release notes of the next major release,
please add the note to this directory as a single text file.

You can use Markdown for formatting, but do not use a `.md` extension to prevent mkdocs from identifying that file.

For details, see:
