- There's now only one Elasticsearch index for both the Admin UI and the External API. Its structure is identical
to the old Admin UI index, thus migration is possible, alternatively the index has to be rebuilt or the old Admin UI
index can be configured (see upgrade guide).
With this change the index rebuild should now be twice as fast as before. The index endpoints to clear and rebuild
the index were moved to /index.
