Improvements
------------

- The Workflow Service does not require a Solr Index anymore, simplifying the installation of Opencast.

Behavior changes
-----------------

- Internally, workflows were stored as huge xml objects in the job table in the databaase. With Opencast 12,
workflows now get their own tables in the database. This makes it easier and quicker to query for workflows when
not using the Solr Index.
