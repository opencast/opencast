- With OC14 comes an optional, new admin ui that seeks to become the stand in future versions

New Admin UI / Admin UI Picard / Admin Interface
------------------------
Opencast 14 brings with it a new version of the admin ui. The new Admin UI continues with the same look and
feel, but uses new technologies under the hood. It strives to be robust and easy to develop for, while having all the
same functionality users expect from the old UI.

For now, the new admin ui has not quite reached those goals yet. Therefore, it is not enabled by default and marked
as beta. If you wish to try it out, you can easily do so by going to `https://your-opencast/admin-ui/index.html`
(don't worry if it looks like nothing has changed, the look is *really* similar :)). If you find any issues,
please report them at https://github.com/opencast/opencast-admin-interface/issues.

For notes on how to set the new admin ui as your default, check [Admin UI](../modules/admin-ui.md).
