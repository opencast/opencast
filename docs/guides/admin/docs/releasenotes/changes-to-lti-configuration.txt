With this release you can configure multiple LTI Custom roles, identifying each of them with a key index for example lti.custom_role_name.1=... lti.custom_roles.1=..., lti.custom_role_name.2=... lti.custom_roles.2=... etc.
Additionally, there's custom_role_name regex support for more flexible roles matching.
Legacy lti.custom_role_name=... and lti.custom_roles=... configuration keys are still supported.
