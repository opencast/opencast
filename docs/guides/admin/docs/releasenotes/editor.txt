New Default Editor
------------------

The default editor of Opencast has changed.
If you want to continue using the internal editor of the old admin interface,
you need to specifically configure this in `etc/org.opencastproject.organization-mh_default_org.cfg`
by configuring `prop.admin.editor.url`.

Note that the old admin interface is deprecated and will be removed in one of the next major releases.
Even if you use the old editor for now, please make sure to test the new one
and report potential problems.
