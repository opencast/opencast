Instead of the `#{compositeCommand}` variable which was build by the composite workflow operation handler and could not
be configured, the composite operation now supports multiple different variables for constructing the ffmpeg command to
create the composite, most of which can be configured in the encoding profile. This is relevant e.g. for GPU encoding.

If you use custom encoding profiles for composite or use the existing profiles in a different way than the standard
workflows do, you might need to make some changes. Specifically, the `#{compositeCommand}` variable is no longer
supported in the ffmpeg command, and the `mp4-preview` profile now only supports dual-streams and no watermark,
while the `composite` profile retains its full functionality, but offers more configuration options than before.

For more details see the updated documentation for the
[composite operation](../workflowoperationhandlers/composite-woh.md).
