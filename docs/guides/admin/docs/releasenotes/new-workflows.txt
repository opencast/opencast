Opencast 11 comes with a completely new set of workflows. Please make sure to check your local configuration and adapt
it accordingly if you made changes to your workflows before. Opencast will also continue to work with the old set of
workflows. The new ones just remove a lot of redundancies, making the whole process more efficient.

Some of the new workflows (e.g. `fast`) now use slightly different workflow configurations. This could potentially cause
problems if you scheduled recordings using the old workflows but have the events processed using the new workflows.
Please make sure the workflow you use work fine, or do not have anything scheduled via the upgrade.
