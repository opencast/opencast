- With OC15 we change a lot how subtitles work in Opencast, you may need to migrate!

Subtitles as first class citizens
---------------------------------------
With Opencast 15 we want to put more emphasis on subtitles. You can find more details on how subtitles should be
handled going forward in [Subtitles](../modules/subtitles.md).

This comes with a bit of migration. Namely, subtitles should not be stored as "attachments" or "catalogs" anymore, but as "media"
(as they is called in the Admin UI) or "tracks" (as the are called internally). Therefore, all subtitle files currently
stored as attachments or catalogs in your events should be moved to tracks. This can easily be accomplished with the "changetype"
workflow operation handler new to Opencast 15. See example below. (Subtitles should then be republished)

Additionally, we recommend adding a language tag `lang:<language-code>` to your subtitle files. While tags for subtitles
are optional, the flavor will not encode the given language for a subtitle anymore, so a language tag is useful for 
identification and display purposes. 
You can read more about subtitles tags in [Subtitles](../modules/subtitles.md).

If your subtitles are not in WebVTT format, they should be converted to WebVTT as well. While other formats are possible,
WebVTT is the only one that will be guaranteed to work.
