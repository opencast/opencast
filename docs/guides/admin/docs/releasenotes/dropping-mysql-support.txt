Dropping MySQL Support
----------------------

Due to the lack of usage and thus testing, we decided to drop the official support of Opencast for MySQL databases.
Please use MariaDB or PostegreSQL instead.

This does not mean that Opencast will stop working with MySQL immediately,
but we like to highlight that developers are not spending any time on testing this,
nor do we provide any configuration examples or support if additional steps may be necessary.
