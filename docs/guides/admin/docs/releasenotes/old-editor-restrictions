Restrictions in regards to what kind of streams can be selected in the old integrated video editor were eased to allow
for more diverse use cases. Previous errors were demoted to warnings. The user still has to select at least one stream,
but publishing e.g. of an audio stream without a video stream is now allowed. For more details see PR 5023.
