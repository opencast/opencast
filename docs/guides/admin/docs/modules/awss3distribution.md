AWS S3 Distribution Configuration
=================================
This page documents the configuration for Opencast module **distribution-service-aws-s3**.  This
configuration is only required on the presentation node, and only if you are using Amazon S3 and/or Cloudfront for
distributing media to end users.

Amazon User Configuration
-------------------------

Configuration of Amazon users is beyond the scope of this documentation, instead we suggest referring to
[Amazon's documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction.html).
You will, however, require to set up proper credentials by either:

* Creating an [Access Key ID and a Secret Access Key](https://aws.amazon.com/developers/access-keys/) or
* Using [Instance Profile Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/java-dg-roles.html)
  (recommended when running Opencast on EC2 instances)

*AmazonS3FullAccess* permission is *required*, which can be granted using
[these instructions](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_inline-using.html).

**A [free Amazon account](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) will work for small scale testing, but be aware that S3
distribution can cost you a lot of money very quickly.  Be aware of how much data and how many requests you are making,
and be sure to [set alarms](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/free-tier-alarms.html) to
notify you of cost overruns.**

Amazon Service Configuration
----------------------------

The development and testing it is generally safe to allow the Opencast AWS S3 Distribution service to create the S3
bucket for you.  It will create the bucket per its configuration, with public read-only access to the files, and no
versioning.  For production use we suggest using Amazon CloudFront, which requires additional configuration.

Amazon CloudFront
-----------------

Amazon CloudFront provides an *optional* way to better handle distributing your media to end users.  While fully
configuring CloudFront is outside the scope of this documentation, we wish to note that this does affect one of the keys
described below.  Please ensure you use the correct distribution base format depending on which service you are using!

Presigned URL
-------------

S3 and Cloudfront work together to speed delivery of your content, but if your media URLs leak then anyone can
download your recordings.  S3 allows you to create **Presigned URL**s, which are only valid for a limited time.  This
means that even if your media URLs leak, they will only be valid for a configurable duration.

Set `org.opencastproject.distribution.aws.s3.presigned.url` to `true` to enable this feature.

Note: **CloudFront** and **Presigned URL** can be used together. 

Note: Opencast's distribution files can be quite large depending on your settings, and some of your users may not be
able to complete the download within the time limit.  While AWS should not stop a download currently in progress, some
players may not completely download the media if playback is stopped.  If you are experiencing complaints about
playback breaking and have presigned URLs enabled, try lengthening the timeout.

Service Default Security Note
-----------------------------

On startup, Opencast checks to see if the S3 bucket exists, and if it does not it creates it.  This bucket has default
permissions allowing anyone to read the full contents of the bucket.  This may not be what you want, depending on your
institutional priorites.  If you wish to protect the files with presigned URLs, then please create the bucket in advance,
with the appropriate security settings.

S3 Compatible Service
----------------------
The S3 API has become the de facto standard interface for almost all storage providers.
This module also supports S3 compatible service.
In this case, `org.opencastproject.distribution.aws.s3.endpoint` should be set to the endpoint of the S3 service.
Meanwhile, `org.opencastproject.distribution.aws.s3.region` should not be set.
Note: only one of these two configuration keys may be set.

There are [two access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingBucket.html) style for bucket, virtual hosted style (default) and path style.
- Virtual hosted style sample: `https://bucketname.s3.service.com/`
- Path style sample: `https://s3.service.com/bucketname`

AWS use virtual hosted style by default, and will deprecate path style. Yet, for self hosted s3 compatible service, path style URL is useful.  
Set `org.opencastproject.distribution.aws.s3.path.style` to `true` to enable this feature.

Opencast Service Configuration
------------------------------

The Opencast AWS S3 Distribution service has five configuration keys, which can be found in the
`org.opencastproject.distribution.aws.s3.AwsS3DistributionServiceImpl.cfg` configuration file.

If *org.opencastproject.distribution.aws.s3.access.id* and *org.opencastproject.distribution.aws.s3.secret.key* are
 not *explicitly* provided, search for credentials will be performed in the order specified by the
 [Default Credentials Provider Chain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/credentials.html).

Using S3 Distribution
---------------------

Amazon S3 distribution is already included in the default Opencast workflows, however it must first be enabled.  The
`schedule-and-upload.xml` and `publish.xml` workflow configuration files both contain lines containing the string
"Remove this line if you wish to publish to AWS S3".  Both of these lines must be removed before publishing to AWS S3
will function correctly.

If you wish to use AWS S3 publishing with your own custom workflow, you must add the `publish-aws` workflow operation to
your workflow.  The operation documentation can be found [here](../workflowoperationhandlers/publish-aws-woh.md).

Publishing to multiple distribution services
--------------------------------------------

Currently we do not support publication to multiple distribution services simultaneously.  This means that whichever
workflow operation is *last* in the workflow will be the final publication.

Using this handler in custom workflows
--------------------------------------

If your workflow contains both `publish-engage` and `publish-aws`, in that order, and without a
[conditional](../configuration/workflow.md) you would have publication files stored both locally *and* in AWS.  This is
likely not what you want, so protect your workflow operations appropriately.  If you really do need these files stored
in both places (for example, in cases where you need to make the files available immediately, and only push to AWS in
some cases) then remember to add a [retract-engage](../workflowoperationhandlers/retract-engage-woh.md) in between the
publication operations.  Note that if this step is omitted the files will remain available locally, but will not be
used.  Of further note, if you retract after publication to AWS then your workflow *will not be available* to users.
To summarize, this table presents a subset of the various situations that are possible

|Workflow Operations|Files present in the Media Module|Files present in AWS|Files served from|
|--|--|--|--|
|publish-engage | Yes | No | Opencast Media Module |
|publish-aws| No | Yes | AWS |
|publish-engage, publish-aws| Yes | Yes | AWS |
|publish-aws, publish-engage| Yes | Yes | Opencast Media Module|
|publish-engage, retract-engage, publish-aws | Temporary | Yes | AWS |
|publish-engage, publish-aws, retract-engage | No | Yes | Not available |

Migrating to S3 Distribution with Pre-Existing Data
---------------------------------------------------

If you already have data published to your local Opencast install, you should be able to republish the media selecting
AWS S3 as the distribution service to use.
